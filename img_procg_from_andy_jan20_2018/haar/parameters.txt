Requires a square image with size MXM where M is a multiple of 16. 
Had to zero-pad the clown image from 200X200 to 256X256.
Original and reconstructed clown images are zero-padded.
Displayed log of Haar transform (this didn't work for Daubechies).

Parameters: sigma=noise level. Range: 0 to max(max(X))/10.
lambda=threshold and shrinkage parameter for wavelet denoising. Range: 0 to sigma.

2 runs: 1st shows program takes Haar wavelet transform of clown image and reconstructs it (sigma=0 and lambda=0).
2nd adds noise with sigma=20 (largest clown pixel=255) and denoises with lambda=sigma=20. Visually much less noise.
