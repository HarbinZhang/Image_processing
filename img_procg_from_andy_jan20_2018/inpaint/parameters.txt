Inpaints a square grayscale image with some pixels set to zero
using ISTA algorithm (may take a few seconds for some parameters).
The example I have ran almost instantly.

Parameters: IMAX=#iterations of ISTA; f=fraction of pixel values kept
lambda=thresholding and shrinkage parameter. Range: 0.01 to 1.
M=image size (read by algorithm).
